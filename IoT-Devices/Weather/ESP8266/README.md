# Temperature Sensor

## Purpose

Each room in a house can have an IoT temperature, humidity, and air pressure sensor so that we can monitor centrally the atmosphere and quality of the air in the house as a whole, and alert the house owner when they've left a window open and it dips below a comfortable temperature.
