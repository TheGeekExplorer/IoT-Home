# Oberon

### What is Oberon?

Oberon is the analytics backend to the ESP32 / ESP8266 Smart Home project.   It provides analytical graphing and data matrices of measurements taken from sensors connected to the network, such as Temperature, Humidity, Air Pressure & Quality, and many others.

You can see this data, and interact with this data, on a Room-by-Room basis, or Device-by-Device basis.  Oberon also provides a number of "mashup" reports where you can see right-now, spot, or historical trending informaton for different rooms at the same time, a bit like a snapshot of time.

### Is it ready?

No.  It's still in the building and design phase, just like the rest of this project.
